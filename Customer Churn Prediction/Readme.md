## Project Overview
The main objective of the Bank Customer Churn Prediction project is to analyze the demographics and financial information of bank customers, predicting whether a customer will leave the bank. Customer churn significantly impacts business and profitability. By accurately predicting churn, the bank can proactively retain valuable customers and enhance satisfaction.

## About the Dataset
The dataset (sourced from Kaggle) comprises 10,000 rows and 14 columns, predicting customer churn based on demographics and financial data.

### Data Dictionary
| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RowNumber | Row number |
| CustomerId | Unique customer ID |
| Surname | Customer's last name |
| CreditScore | Customer's credit score |
| Geography | Country of the customer |
| Age | Age of the customer |
| Tenure | Years with the bank |
| Balance | Bank balance |
| NumOfProducts | Number of bank products used |
| HasCrCard | Has a credit card (binary flag) |
| IsActiveMember | Active member status (binary flag) |
| EstimatedSalary | Customer's estimated salary |
| Exited | Churn status (1 if closed account, 0 if retained) |

By leveraging this dataset, the project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling the bank to implement targeted retention strategies and improve loyalty.
